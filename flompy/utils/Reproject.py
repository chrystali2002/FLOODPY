    """This function reprojects an image (``slave``) to
    match the extent, resolution and projection of another
    (``master``) using GDAL. The newly reprojected image
    is a GDAL VRT file for efficiency. A different spatial
    resolution can be chosen by specifyign the optional
    ``res`` parameter. The function returns the new file's
    name.
    Parameters
    -------------
    master: str 
        A filename (with full path if required) with the 
        master image (that that will be taken as a reference)
    slave: str 
        A filename (with path if needed) with the image
        that will be reprojected
    res: float, optional
        The desired output spatial resolution, if different

    ----------
    The reprojected filename
