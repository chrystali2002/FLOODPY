Quickstart
==========

Before running FLOODPY we strongly suggest you to:

- Find the **geographical borders** of your area of interest (min/max latitude and longitude). For example, you can extract the geographical coordinates (lats,lons) or save a geojson file of you area of interest from `here <https://geojson.io>`_.

- Define the start and end datetimes for Pre-flood time span and flood time span (Format is YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS in UTC).

You can run FLOODPY using  **Jupyter Notebook**. 

Example can be found :doc:`here <Floodpyapp_notebook>`.
