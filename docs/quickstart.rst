Quickstart
==========

Before running FLOODPY we strongly suggest you to:

- Find the **geographical borders** of your area of interest (min/max latitude and longitude). For example, you can extract the geographical coordinates (lats,lons) or save a geojson file of you area of interest from `here <https://geojson.io>`_.


- Define one single **flood peak datetime** in the following format DDMMYYYYTHHMMSS (e.g. 10022023T090000 represents the 23rd of February of 2023 09:00 am) of the flood event you want to study. For example, for recent flood events you can have a look `here <https://floodlist.com/>`_.


FLOODPY expects you to provide the abovementioned parameters. If you have any questions have a look at one of our case studies `here <https://github.com/kleok/FLOODPY-docs>`_. 

Currectly, you can run FLOODPY using  **Jupyter Notebook** or **Command Line**.

1. Instructions for **Jupyter Notebook** can be found :doc:`here <quickstart_jupyter>`.
2. Instructions for **Command Line** can be found :doc:`here <quickstart_cli>`.
