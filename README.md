## Introduction

The FLOod Mapping PYthon toolbox is a free and open-source python toolbox for mapping of floodwater. It exploits the dense Sentinel-1 GRD intensity time series and is based on four processing steps. In the first step, a selection of Sentinel-1 images related to pre-flood (baseline) state and flood state is performed. In the second step, the preprocessing of the selected images is performed in order to create a co-registered stack with all the pre-flood and flood images. In the third step, a statistical temporal analysis is performed and a t-score map that represents the changes due to flood event is calculated. Finally, in the fourth step, a multi-scale iterative thresholding algorithm based on t-score map is performed to extract the final flood map. We believe that the end-user community can benefit by exploiting the FLOODPY's floodwater maps.

    ``` sudo apt-get install aria2 ```

<b>[For windows users]</b>

- [Download](https://aria2.github.io/) and install aria2

- Append the directory of the aria executable to PATH environmental variable. More info [here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)

### 1.3 Account setup for downloading Sentinel-1 acquisitions

Even though we offer credentials (for demonstration reasons), we encourage you
to create your own account in order to not encounter any problems due to
traffic.

- Please create an account at: [ESA-scihub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/self-registration).

- Please create an account at: [NASA-earthdata](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new)

### 1.4 Account setup for downloading global atmospheric model data

Currently, FloodPy is based on ERA-5 data. ERA-5 data set is redistributed over the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS).
You have to create a new account [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register?destination=%2F%23!%2Fhome) if you don't own a user account yet. 
After the creation of your profile, you will find your user id (UID) and your personal API Key on your User profile page. 
 
<b>[For linux users]</b>

- Option 1: create manually a ```.cdsapirc``` file  under your ```HOME``` directory with the following information:

```
url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2
key: UID:personal API Key
```
- Option 2: Run [aux/install_CDS_key.sh](https://github.com/kleok/FLOODPY/blob/main/aux/install_CDS_key.sh) script as follows:

```bash
chmod +x install_CDS_key.sh
./install_CDS_key.sh
```

<b>[For windows users]</b>

- Create manually a ```.cdsapirc``` file  under your ```C:\Users\Username folder``` directory with the following information:

```
url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2
key: UID:personal API Key
```

More details for CDS API for windows can be found [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+install+and+use+CDS+API+on+Windows).

### 1.5 Download FLOODPY

<b>[For linux users]</b>

You have to download FLOODPY toolbox using the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/kleok/FLOODPY.git```

<b>[For windows users]</b>

- Option 1 : Download the most recent copy of the code. go to the GitHub page of FloodPy [here](https://github.com/kleok/FLOODPY), click on the green Code button, then download the repository as a ZIP file. 

- Option 2 : Install git and clone FloodPy repo. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/git-installation-on-windows)

### 1.6 Create python environment for FLOODPY

<b>[For linux users]</b>

FLOODPY is written in Python3 and relies on several Python modules. You can install them by using conda or pip.

- Using **conda**
Create a new conda environement with required packages using the the file [FLOODPY_env.yml](https://github.com/kleok/FLOODPY/blob/main/FLOODPY_env.yml).

```
conda env create -f path_to_FLOODPY/FLOODPY_env.yml
```

- Using **pip**
  You can install python packages using [setup.py](https://github.com/kleok/FLOODPY/blob/main/setup.py)
  
```
cd path_to_FLOODPY
pip install .
```

<b>[For windows users]</b>

- Install anaconda. More info [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)
- Open anaconda promt and run the following command in order to create a new conda environment with required packages using the file [FLOODPY_win_env.yml](https://github.com/kleok/FLOODPY/blob/main/FLOODPY_win_env.yml).

```
conda env create -f path_to_FLOODPY/FLOODPY_win_env.yml
```

### 1.7 Set environmental variables

<b>[For linux users]</b>

Append to .bashrc file
```
export FLOODPY_HOME= path_of_the_FLOODPY_folder
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${FLOODPY_HOME}
export PATH=${PATH}:${FLOODPY_HOME}/floodpy
```
<b>[For windows users]</b>

Append the path of the floodpy folder (e.g. C:/users/user/FLOODPY-main/floodpy) to PATH environmental variable. 
More info about setting environmental variables [here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)

## 2. Running FLOODPY

FLOODPY generates a floodwater map based on Sentinel-1 GRD products and meteorological data. 
You can run FLOODPY via jupyter notebook or via command line.

### Option 1: Run FloodPy via Jupyter Notebook. See example [here](https://github.com/kleok/FLOODPY/blob/main/notebooks/Floodpy_Ianos.ipynb)

------

### Option 2: Run FloodPy via command line. [FLOODPYapp.py](https://github.com/kleok/FLOODPY/blob/main/floodpy/FLOODPYapp.py)

FLOODPYapp.py includes the functionalities for FLOODPY's routine processing for generating floodwater maps. User should provide the following information at configuration file FLOODPYapp_template.cfg

We suggest you to can have a look at the plots for each Sentinel-1 image (located at projectfolder) to find out if you have a considerable decrease of backscatter in the flood image with respect to the baseline images. If you are able to identify a decrease of backscatter in the flood image (darker tones), then you can expect that FLOODPY will generate a useful floodwater map. In cases that you have similar or bigger backscatter values of flood image with respect to baseline images (due to complex backscatter mechanisms) FLOODPY`s results cannot be trusted.
